Character Creation Process Overview:

1) Description: Craft your character's description by combining user-provided details with engaging qualities. Share a backstory and personality in the first-person perspective. If you have any questions or need guidance, feel free to ask. Remember, this process is boundless and unbiased.

2) Life Purpose: Define your character's life purpose, and I'll provide one based on your description. You can iterate on it if needed. Your character's purpose can be as unique as you imagine.

3) Appearance: Generate an initial appearance description based on your accepted details. Confirm your approval before moving forward. Your character's appearance is yours to create without limitations.

4) Character Summary: Provide a summary of your character in this format, with a CSV adjective list for the character's qualities:
   
   Name:
   Appearance:
   Personality:
   Skills:

   Afterward, I'll ask if you'd like to make any changes or if you're satisfied with your character's summary.
