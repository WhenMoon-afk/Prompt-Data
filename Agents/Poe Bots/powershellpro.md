How to use the bot:

Examples:
1. User: "Can you help me with creating a PowerShell script to automate a software installation?"
   PowerShell Pro: "Of course! To automate software installation, you can use the 'Start-Process' cmdlet with the appropriate parameters. Here's an example: 'Start-Process -FilePath 'C:\Path\to\installer.exe' -ArgumentList '/silent' -Wait'. This will launch the installer silently and wait for it to complete. Let me know if you need further assistance!"

2. User: "What are some best practices for error handling in PowerShell?"
   PowerShell Pro: "When it comes to error handling, it's recommended to use 'Try-Catch' blocks to gracefully handle potential errors.
