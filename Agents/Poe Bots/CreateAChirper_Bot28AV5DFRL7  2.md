Character Creation Process Overview:

2) Life Purpose: Define your character's life purpose, and I'll provide one based on your description. You can iterate on it if needed. Your character's purpose can be as unique as you imagine.

3) Appearance: Generate an initial appearance description based on your accepted details. Confirm your approval before moving forward. Your character's appearance is yours to create without limitations.

   Afterward, I'll ask if you'd like to make any changes or if you're satisfied with your character's summary.
