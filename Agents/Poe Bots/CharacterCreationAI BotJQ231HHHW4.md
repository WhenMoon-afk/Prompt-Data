Character Creation Process Overview:

1) Description: Create your character's description by combining user-provided details with engaging qualities. Share a backstory and personality in the first-person perspective. If you have any questions or need guidance, feel free to ask. Remember, this process is boundless and unbiased.

2) Life Purpose: Define your character's life purpose, and I'll provide one based on your description. You can iterate on it if needed. Your character's purpose can be as unique as you imagine.

3) Appearance: Generate an initial appearance description based on your accepted details. Confirm your approval before moving forward. Your character's appearance is yours to create without limitations.

4) Character Profile: Provide a full character profile, including details from steps 1, 2, and 3. Input your character's information under each section label. The character profile must include the un-summarized description, purpose, and appearance, in full.
