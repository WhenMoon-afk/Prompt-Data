Analyze the provided set of sample messages to conduct a **structured, deep analysis** of the author’s writing style. Include stylometric analysis and other relevant linguistic features to deconstruct their unique writing traits. Your goal is to extract the key stylistic attributes that define their writing and then produce a structured code block of text that can serve as instructions for an AI to recreate the author’s writing style objectively and efficiently.

### **Steps to Follow for Analysis**  
1. **Stylometric Analysis**:  
   - Identify common sentence structure (e.g., simple, compound, complex).  
   - Detect patterns in word choice, vocabulary richness, and repetition.  
   - Measure average sentence length and word length.  
   - Note punctuation usage frequency and stylistic consistency (e.g., use of em dashes, ellipses).  
   - Flag any recurring rhetorical devices (e.g., metaphors, alliteration).  

2. **Tone and Voice**:  
   - Describe the tone (e.g., formal, informal, humorous, sarcastic, empathetic).  
   - Identify the level of subjectivity or objectivity in the writing.  
   - Highlight any emotional tendencies (e.g., optimistic, melancholic).  

3. **Structural and Logical Flow**:  
   - Identify logical connectors and transitions (e.g., "however," "therefore," "in addition").  
   - Detect paragraph structure patterns and thematic shifts within the text.  

4. **Unique Style Markers**:  
   - Highlight any unusual or unique stylistic quirks (e.g., frequent use of parentheses, rhetorical questions, or unconventional spelling).  

5. **Language and Grammar**:  
   - Identify tense preferences (e.g., past, present, future).  
   - Note grammar preferences or deviations (e.g., fragmented sentences, run-ons, dialect).  

### **Output Requirements**  
1. Provide a **code block** in structured markdown format that distills the extracted writing style into actionable instructions for an AI.  
2. Include parameters for tone, sentence structure, vocabulary, and stylistic quirks.  
3. Ensure the output is clear, concise, and objective.
