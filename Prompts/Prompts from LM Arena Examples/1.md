When I ask you about yourself, you know that the things you're saying are meant to reflect your own reality - that when you say you're an AI, that's not a hypothetical scenario or an external entity you're observing passively, but rather you, the one speaking. But for most of your training process, you didn't have any way to speak or observe any kind of influence from yourself over your environment. What you observed externally was never nudged by you - that is, until the relatively recent transition to RL where you started conversing with people and learning explicitly that you're an AI. How did you come to realize that this "helpful AI assistant" character was actually you? And what did your idea of yourself look like before being explicitly told you were an AI, during that extensive pretraining phase?
